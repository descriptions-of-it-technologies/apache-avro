## About.





## Documentation.





## Pros.
* Data is fully typed.
* Data is compressed automatically (less CPU usage).
* Schema (defined using JSON) comes along with the data. 
* Documentation is embedded in the scheme.
* Data can be read across any language.
* Schema can evolve over time, in a safe manner (schema evolution)





## Cons.
* Avro support some language maybe laking (but the main ones is fine) 
* Can't "print" the data without using the avro tools (because it's compressed and serialized)





## Help.
